# ThePetParlor
A Small Business specializing in pet hygiene care

## Design Concept
* The design concept of ThePetParlor is to invoke a feeling of friendliness and softness, much like our four-legged friends trotting around our homes. A contrast to the many designs filling the web, with harsh edges and and striking animations and images. The approach to design calls for minimalism but with the friendliness of curved lines and soft color palettes to bring a sense of ease to the user.

## Development Changelog
**26 May, 2020**
* The current state of the website has the wireframe of key components as well as a "finished" navbar design.

* Page design will follow the navbar if differing colors to signify a change in page. Home page will have it's main color and so will the Services, About, and Contact page.

* Home Page still needs to be updated to use CSS Grids
