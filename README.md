## Website Concept
* We often think of our pets as friends or companions. They're often seen as cute, lovable, fluffy things that we could spend all day with. They are, for the most part, friendly.

* With the PetParlor website, I've taken the approach of making the page friendly, and non-aggressive. Trimming the corners for something seen as soft.

* The colors also play a role with this design idea. Opting for soft, pastel colors instead of the bright and vibrant colors that are very forward.
